<h2>Past researches</h2>
<section>
    <h3>1. OCR PDF collection in Google Drive</h3>
    <p>This project is developed with <a href="https://bids.berkeley.edu/people/adam-g-anderson">Dr. Adam Anderson</a> at Berkeley's D-Lab. The purpose is to help scholars obtain raw text files from PDFs fast, so they can apply any nlp analysis on their data easily.<br> 
        Users only have to store their PDFs in a google folder and put the path in the colab notebook. Our program will detect the abnormality in PDFs if there were any. You can try it out <a href="https://github.com/Kenan-Jiang/PDF2Page-with-OCR">here</a>.</p>
